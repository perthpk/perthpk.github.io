### About the Perth Parkour community.

The goal of the Perth Parkour Community is to teach people the basics of Parkour and to spread the right message to increase understanding and awareness of Parkour. We help teach people of all ages, sizes and fitness levels how to train Parkour from the ground up.

### What is Parkour?

Parkour is a physical discipline in which one trains to become efficient in their movement In order to overcome obstacles (both physical and mental) This can involve running, jumping, climbing, balancing, etc.

Often confused with freerunning, Parkour is more about efficiency, movement that can assist you in a "reach or escape" emergency situation. Freerunning while involving a lot of similar movement to Parkour, it's more about esthetics and expression than efficiency.

### Training and progression

Individuals will progress at different speeds. it is important to make sure you are capable of things before you try them ie: doing a jump on the ground many times before doing it anywhere above ground level.

Parkour also involves a lot of strength and conditioning training to help prepare one's body to handle things you may encounter, and to prevent any serious injuries.

"Be strong to be useful" "to be and to last" are common terms used in Parkour, our bodies are important and we must look after them for all our life.
