### Casual training

Keen to get out there and train, but you can't wait until the Saturday Class or the next workshop?

Perth Parkour has thriving community of friendly and helpful practitioners, who regularly meet up for training outside of the structured class times.

We have a Facebook page ([Gatherings and Jams](https://www.facebook.com/groups/294367510617301/)) to organise informal meetups and training.

If you can't make the classes or the jams, some of the most valuable training to be had is often by yourself: get out there, explore, have fun, and be safe.
